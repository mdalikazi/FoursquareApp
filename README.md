* v1.0 and v2.0 (with map support)
* Challenge requirements
     * Current location has to update continuously
     * Items must be sorted by distance in ascending order
     * Each item has to show name, distance and address
     * Bonus: Add some extra features to improve the user experience, such as ability to call the coffee shop or find it on the map (via Maps app)
